Component based.  Components made up of parent child relationships.  Children components can be used under other parent components as long as the data doesn't need to be different.


Virtual DOM - staging area for the render.  Keeps track of all changes and before sending to the DOM to render.
    virtual DOM -> DOM -> render

create-react-app [app name]
    Tool to create react apps and set up file structure

    npm start - starts running the app


Compontent names must always be Pascal case ie <App />

Never do default and destructuring.  If no default, destructure.

class App extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super();

        this.state={
            happiness: 3
        }
    }
    makeMoreHappy() {
        let nextHappiness = this.state.happiness + 1;
        let happinessColor = 'red';
        if(nextHappiness > )
    }
}

render() {
    return (
        <div
    )
}


setState tells react to re-render.  If you just declare this.state, react does not re-render.
