#Object and Arrays

I'll be lecturing directly from LessonPlan.md and taking breaks to work through the small problems in the various directories.
Also I'll be taking notes in the various markdown (md) files throughout the repo.
Everything including notes and solutions to problems will be committed to a branch specifically for your class at the end of lecture.
